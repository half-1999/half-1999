## 🏛️ Architecture & Design Philosophy (NEW SECTION)

My approach ensures resilience, testability, and easy feature expansion.

### **Backend Structure**
I champion **Clean Architecture** (Onion/Hexagonal) in my Node.js services. This involves clear separation of **Domain Entities**, **Use Cases (Business Logic)**, **Interface Adapters (Controllers/Gateways)**, and the **Framework/Database**.

* **Benefits:** **Decoupled** layers, making logic testable independent of the database or framework (Express.js).

### **Data Modeling**
* **MongoDB:** Implementing highly-efficient denormalized schema designs tailored for high-read scenarios in FinTech.
* **Performance:** Utilizing advanced techniques like **indexing strategies** and **query projections** for sub-millisecond response times.
